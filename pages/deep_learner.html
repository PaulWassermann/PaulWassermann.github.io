            <p>What is Deep Learner ? At its core, Deep Learner is a reverse-mode 
                automatic differentiation engine. We'll get to that part later, 
                because we first need to address the elephant in the room : 
                doesn't it look exactly like PyTorch (add link) ? Well, yes it 
                does, and that's on purpose. Although the implementations are 
                completely original, the public API of Deep Learner is, for the
                most part, taken from PyTorch. And why is that ? The first, 
                honest reason is that I think PyTorch has a well-designed, 
                intuitive and pratical API, so why not just keep it ? The other,
                more down-to-earth reason is that I want to be able to quickly
                switch from Deep Learner to PyTorch and vice-versa, which can be
                done seamlessly since they share a common public API.
